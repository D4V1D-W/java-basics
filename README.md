- Using objects to access data and execute actions
- Separating responsibilities between classes

---

- Writing safer and more maintainable code

---

## Day 8 – Constructors

- Created a child class (`Student`)
- Reused attributes and methods
- Practiced the "is-a" relationship in Java

---

- ## Day 10 – Polymorphism and Method Overriding

On this day, I learned and applied polymorphism in Java using inheritance
and encapsulation.

Key concepts practiced:
- Method overriding using `@Override`
- Using parent class references to point to child class objects
- Runtime method dispatch (dynamic polymorphism)
- Clean object-oriented design without conditionals (`if` / `instanceof`)

I implemented different behaviors for the same method (`greet()`)
depending on the actual object type, reinforcing how Java resolves
method calls at runtime.

---

## Day 11 – Abstraction and Interfaces

On this day, I learned how to use interfaces in Java to achieve abstraction
and decouple system components.

Key concepts practiced:
- Creating and using interfaces as contracts
- Implementing interfaces with different classes
- Applying polymorphism through interfaces
- Designing flexible and scalable code

This approach is fundamental for building real-world
applications and is widely used in frameworks like Spring Boot.

--- 

## Day 12 – Abstract Classes vs Interfaces

On this day, I learned the difference between abstract classes
and interfaces in Java and how they are used together.

Key concepts practiced:
- Creating abstract classes with shared state and behavior
- Implementing abstract methods in child classes
- Defining interfaces as contracts
- Combining inheritance with interfaces

This knowledge is essential for designing clean architectures
and is widely used in enterprise frameworks like Spring.

--- 

## Day 13 – Abstract Classes and Design Improvement
- Introduction to abstract classes in Java
- Conversion of the Person class into an abstract class
- Use of abstract methods to enforce implementation in subclasses
- Implementation of specific behaviors in Student and Teacher using @Override
- Improved object-oriented design through inheritance and abstraction
- Refactoring without breaking existing functionality

--- 

## Day 14 – Polymorphism with Arrays
- Use of arrays with parent class references (Person[])
- Storing different child objects (Student, Teacher) in the same array
- Iterating objects using for-each loop
- Runtime method dispatch (dynamic polymorphism)
- Cleaner and more scalable object management

Today I learned how to use arrays with polymorphism to manage multiple objects in a cleaner and more scalable way.

Instead of creating and using each object separately, I created an array of type Person and stored different objects like Student and Teacher.

Then, I iterated through the array and called the same methods for all objects.

Thanks to polymorphism, Java automatically executed the correct version of each method depending on the real object type.

Concepts applied together:
- Encapsulation  
- Inheritance  
- Interfaces  
- Method overriding  

--- 

## Day 15 – Polymorphism with ArrayList
- Introduction to Java Collections using ArrayList
- Replacement of fixed-size arrays with dynamic collections
- Managing multiple objects using a parent class reference (Person)
- Applying polymorphism with collections
- Iterating objects using enhanced for-each loop
- Cleaner and more scalable object-oriented design

On this day, I replaced arrays with an ArrayList to store and manage multiple objects such as Student and Teacher using the Person parent class.

By using an ArrayList, objects can be added dynamically, making the program more flexible and closer to real-world Java applications.

Polymorphism ensures that the correct overridden methods are executed at runtime when iterating through the collection.

---

## Day 16 – Programming to Interfaces with List
- Introduction to programming against interfaces
- Using List instead of concrete implementations
- Improved flexibility and decoupled design
- Polymorphism with collections
- Cleaner and more professional object-oriented architecture

On this day, I refactored the code to use the List interface instead of directly using ArrayList.

This approach allows changing the underlying collection implementation without affecting the rest of the program, improving flexibility and maintainability.

This design follows best practices used in real-world Java applications and frameworks like Spring Boot.

---

## Day 17 – Exception Handling in Java
- Introduction to exception handling using try-catch-finally
- Handling invalid data using IllegalArgumentException
- Improving program robustness and stability
- Preventing application crashes with controlled error handling
- Applying validation logic to existing object-oriented design

On this day, I added exception handling to manage invalid data and runtime errors without breaking the program.

Using try-catch blocks, the application can handle errors gracefully and continue execution in a controlled way.

This approach is essential for building reliable and professional Java applications, especially in backend development.

---

## Day 18 – Custom Exceptions in Java
- Introduction to custom exceptions in Java
- Creating user-defined exceptions by extending RuntimeException
- Applying domain-specific validation rules
- Improving error clarity and debugging
- Writing cleaner and more expressive error handling code

On this day, I implemented a custom exception to handle specific business rules instead of relying only on generic exceptions.

By creating my own exception class and extending RuntimeException, I was able to represent errors in a clearer and more meaningful way, improving code readability and maintainability.

This approach reflects real-world Java backend practices and prepares the codebase for scalable and professional application development.

---

---

## Day 19 – Code Organization and Refactoring

- Refactoring the Main class to improve readability
- Separating test logic into dedicated methods per learning day
- Improving code organization without changing functionality
- Applying clean code principles to existing Java projects
- Preparing the project structure for future testing and scalability

On this day, I focused on organizing and refactoring my existing code instead of adding new features.

I cleaned up the main method by extracting daily tests into separate methods, making the program easier to read, maintain, and extend.

This refactoring reflects real-world Java development practices, where improving code structure and clarity is just as important as learning new language features.

---

## Day 20 – Enums and Clean Domain Modeling

- Introduction to enums in Java
- Replacing magic strings with controlled enum values
- Improving type safety and code readability
- Refactoring existing classes to use enums
- Applying cleaner domain modeling practices

On this day, I learned how to use enums to represent fixed sets of values instead of relying on raw strings.

I refactored existing classes to replace repeated string values with enums, reducing potential errors and improving code clarity.

This approach reflects real-world Java development practices, where enums are commonly used to model states, categories, and domain-specific values.

---

## Day 21 – Separation of Responsibilities and Clean Design

- Applying Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Avoiding bloated models in object-oriented design
- Separating validation logic from domain models
- Improving code maintainability and clarity
- Preparing the project structure for future scalability (Spring Boot-ready)

On this day, I focused on improving the overall design of the application by ensuring that each class has a clear and single responsibility.

I avoided placing excessive logic inside the Person model, reinforcing the idea that domain models should represent data and behavior, not handle all validations or business rules.

This approach leads to cleaner, more professional Java code and prepares the project for future growth and integration with frameworks like Spring Boot.
