# 🌱 Java Basics - My Learning Journey

Hello! I'm David and this is my daily practice space with Java. Here I will document my progress from zero to building professional projects.

## 🚀My Mission
"One commit a day keeps incompetence away"

Main goal: Systematically learn Java and create a portfolio that demonstrates my growth as a developer.

## Day 1 – Variables and Conditional Logic
- Java project setup
- Variables declaration
- `if / else` statements
- Simple logic to determine if a person is an adult

---

## Day 2 – User Input with Scanner
- Reading user input using `Scanner`
- Handling integer input
- Basic interaction through the console
- Improving program usability

---

## Day 3 – Control Flow and Input Validation
- Input validation using `hasNextInt()`
- Handling invalid user input
- Conditional logic with `if / else if / else`
- Defensive programming practices

---

## Day 4 – Loops and Validation Logic
- `while` loops
- Repeating input until valid data is entered
- Preventing program crashes
- Cleaner and safer input handling

---

## Day 5 – Menus, Methods and Program Flow
- Interactive menu using `while`
- `switch` statement
- Method separation
- Program flow control
- Building more realistic console applications

---

## Day 6 – Classes and Objects (OOP Basics)
- Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Creation of classes and objects
- Understanding attributes (state) and methods (behavior)
- Using objects to access data and execute actions
- Separating responsibilities between classes

---

## Day 7 – Encapsulation (private, getters and setters)
- Data encapsulation using private attributes
- Controlled access with getters and setters
- Using `this` keyword
- Input validation inside setters
- Writing safer and more maintainable code

---

## Day 8 – Constructors
- Understanding constructors in Java
- Initializing objects using constructors
- Using default and parameterized constructors
- Using `this` keyword
- Creating safer object initialization

 ---

- ## Day 9 – Inheritance

- Implemented inheritance using `extends`
- Created a parent class (`Person`)
- Created a child class (`Student`)
- Reused attributes and methods
- Practiced the "is-a" relationship in Java

---

- ## Day 10 – Polymorphism and Method Overriding

On this day, I learned and applied polymorphism in Java using inheritance
and encapsulation.

Key concepts practiced:
- Method overriding using `@Override`
- Using parent class references to point to child class objects
- Runtime method dispatch (dynamic polymorphism)
- Clean object-oriented design without conditionals (`if` / `instanceof`)

I implemented different behaviors for the same method (`greet()`)
depending on the actual object type, reinforcing how Java resolves
method calls at runtime.

---

## Day 11 – Abstraction and Interfaces

On this day, I learned how to use interfaces in Java to achieve abstraction
and decouple system components.

Key concepts practiced:
- Creating and using interfaces as contracts
- Implementing interfaces with different classes
- Applying polymorphism through interfaces
- Designing flexible and scalable code

This approach is fundamental for building real-world
applications and is widely used in frameworks like Spring Boot.

--- 

## Day 12 – Abstract Classes vs Interfaces

On this day, I learned the difference between abstract classes
and interfaces in Java and how they are used together.

Key concepts practiced:
- Creating abstract classes with shared state and behavior
- Implementing abstract methods in child classes
- Defining interfaces as contracts
- Combining inheritance with interfaces

This knowledge is essential for designing clean architectures
and is widely used in enterprise frameworks like Spring.

--- 

## Day 13 – Abstract Classes
- Use of abstract classes as base templates
- Combination of implemented and abstract methods
- Inheritance with partial logic
- Use of super() to reuse constructors and behavior
- Better system design with shared logic
