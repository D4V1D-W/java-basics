# 🌱 Java Basics - My Learning Journey

Hello! I'm David and this is my daily practice space with Java. Here I will document my progress from zero to building professional projects.

## 🚀My Mission
"One commit a day keeps incompetence away"

Main goal: Systematically learn Java and create a portfolio that demonstrates my growth as a developer.

## Day 1 – Variables and Conditional Logic
- Java project setup
- Variables declaration
- `if / else` statements
- Simple logic to determine if a person is an adult

---

## Day 2 – User Input with Scanner
- Reading user input using `Scanner`
- Handling integer input
- Basic interaction through the console
- Improving program usability

---

## Day 3 – Control Flow and Input Validation
- Input validation using `hasNextInt()`
- Handling invalid user input
- Conditional logic with `if / else if / else`
- Defensive programming practices

---

## Day 4 – Loops and Validation Logic
- `while` loops
- Repeating input until valid data is entered
- Preventing program crashes
- Cleaner and safer input handling

---

## Day 5 – Menus, Methods and Program Flow
- Interactive menu using `while`
- `switch` statement
- Method separation
- Program flow control
- Building more realistic console applications

---

## Day 6 – Classes and Objects (OOP Basics)
- Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Creation of classes and objects
- Understanding attributes (state) and methods (behavior)
- Using objects to access data and execute actions
- Separating responsibilities between classes

---

## Day 7 – Encapsulation (private, getters and setters)
- Data encapsulation using private attributes
- Controlled access with getters and setters
- Using `this` keyword
- Input validation inside setters
- Writing safer and more maintainable code

---

## Day 8 – Constructors
- Understanding constructors in Java
- Initializing objects using constructors
- Using default and parameterized constructors
- Using `this` keyword
- Creating safer object initialization

 ---

- ## Day 9 – Inheritance

- Implemented inheritance using `extends`
- Created a parent class (`Person`)
- Created a child class (`Student`)
- Reused attributes and methods
- Practiced the "is-a" relationship in Java

---

- ## Day 10 – Polymorphism and Method Overriding

On this day, I learned and applied polymorphism in Java using inheritance
and encapsulation.

Key concepts practiced:
- Method overriding using `@Override`
- Using parent class references to point to child class objects
- Runtime method dispatch (dynamic polymorphism)
- Clean object-oriented design without conditionals (`if` / `instanceof`)

I implemented different behaviors for the same method (`greet()`)
depending on the actual object type, reinforcing how Java resolves
method calls at runtime.

---

## Day 11 – Abstraction and Interfaces

On this day, I learned how to use interfaces in Java to achieve abstraction
and decouple system components.

Key concepts practiced:
- Creating and using interfaces as contracts
- Implementing interfaces with different classes
- Applying polymorphism through interfaces
- Designing flexible and scalable code

This approach is fundamental for building real-world
applications and is widely used in frameworks like Spring Boot.

--- 

## Day 12 – Abstract Classes vs Interfaces

On this day, I learned the difference between abstract classes
and interfaces in Java and how they are used together.

Key concepts practiced:
- Creating abstract classes with shared state and behavior
- Implementing abstract methods in child classes
- Defining interfaces as contracts
- Combining inheritance with interfaces

This knowledge is essential for designing clean architectures
and is widely used in enterprise frameworks like Spring.

--- 

## Day 13 – Abstract Classes and Design Improvement
- Introduction to abstract classes in Java
- Conversion of the Person class into an abstract class
- Use of abstract methods to enforce implementation in subclasses
- Implementation of specific behaviors in Student and Teacher using @Override
- Improved object-oriented design through inheritance and abstraction
- Refactoring without breaking existing functionality

--- 

## Day 14 – Polymorphism with Arrays
- Use of arrays with parent class references (Person[])
- Storing different child objects (Student, Teacher) in the same array
- Iterating objects using for-each loop
- Runtime method dispatch (dynamic polymorphism)
- Cleaner and more scalable object management

Today I learned how to use arrays with polymorphism to manage multiple objects in a cleaner and more scalable way.

Instead of creating and using each object separately, I created an array of type Person and stored different objects like Student and Teacher.

Then, I iterated through the array and called the same methods for all objects.

Thanks to polymorphism, Java automatically executed the correct version of each method depending on the real object type.

Concepts applied together:
- Encapsulation  
- Inheritance  
- Interfaces  
- Method overriding  

--- 

## Day 15 – Polymorphism with ArrayList
- Introduction to Java Collections using ArrayList
- Replacement of fixed-size arrays with dynamic collections
- Managing multiple objects using a parent class reference (Person)
- Applying polymorphism with collections
- Iterating objects using enhanced for-each loop
- Cleaner and more scalable object-oriented design

On this day, I replaced arrays with an ArrayList to store and manage multiple objects such as Student and Teacher using the Person parent class.

By using an ArrayList, objects can be added dynamically, making the program more flexible and closer to real-world Java applications.

Polymorphism ensures that the correct overridden methods are executed at runtime when iterating through the collection.
